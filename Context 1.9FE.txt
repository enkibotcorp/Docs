Context 1.9: Frontend Implementation and Backend Integration Plan
Overview of Current Status
We have successfully transitioned from Bubble.io to a custom React frontend, leveraging your existing codebase. This strategic pivot allows us to maintain greater control over the application architecture while accelerating development by building on your established frontend foundation. The React frontend now includes all the necessary components for our MVP, with enhanced UI/UX that aligns with our product vision.
In parallel, we have completed the development of several critical backend services:
LangChain API: Our conversational engine that manages different LLM models and coordinates context, queries, and tools.
Tool Manager: A fully functional service for CRUD operations on tools with PostgreSQL persistence.
RAG Module: Recently completed service for document management and retrieval-augmented generation.
Multi-Tenant Architecture: Robust tenant isolation with separate PostgreSQL schemas.
Communication Channels: Adapters for WhatsApp, Telegram, Email, and Telephony.
Frontend Components Overview
The React frontend now includes the following enhanced components:
1. Dashboard (Dashboard.jsx)
Statistics Cards: Displays key metrics (Active Agents, Available Tools, Processed Documents, Recent Interactions)
Quick Actions: Buttons for creating agents, uploading documents, configuring channels, and viewing analytics
Recent Activity: Timeline of recent system events and interactions
Implementation Details: Uses Framer Motion for animations and responsive grid layouts
2. Master Configuration (MasterConfig.jsx)
Tabbed Interface: Organized into General Settings, API Configuration, LLM Models, and Security & Access
Organization Settings: Name, language, timezone, and date format configuration
API Management: API key management, webhook configuration, and rate limits
LLM Model Selection: Default model configuration with options for OpenAI, Google AI, and local models
Security Settings: Session timeout, IP allowlist, 2FA, content filtering, and data retention policies
3. General Knowledge (GeneralKnowledge.jsx)
Document Management: Table view of all uploaded documents with status indicators
Document Upload: Modal interface for uploading new documents with metadata
Document Details: View for examining document processing status and content
Search & Filter: Functionality to locate specific documents
4. Agents (Agents.jsx)
Agent Cards: Visual display of agents with status, model, channels, and tools
Test Interface: Modal for testing conversations with agents
Search & Filter: Options to filter by status and search by name/description
Quick Navigation: Direct links to edit or test each agent
5. Agent Creation (AgentCreation.jsx)
Basic Configuration: Name, description, and tags
Advanced Settings: Language selection, first message, system prompt
Model Selection: LLM model choice with temperature and token limit settings
Visual Flow Editor: Diagram-based conversation flow configuration
6. Tools (Tools.jsx)
Tool Management: Table of available tools with actions (edit, test, delete)
Tool Configuration: Form for creating/editing tools with endpoint, method, and auth settings
Parameter Management: Interface for defining tool parameters with types and requirements
Testing Panel: Interface for executing tool actions and viewing responses
7. Channels (Channels.jsx)
Channel List: Table of configured communication channels with status indicators
Channel Configuration: Forms for setting up different channel types (WhatsApp, Telegram, Email, Phone)
Status Monitoring: Visual indicators of channel connectivity
Quick Actions: Options to edit, test, or disable channels
8. Analytics (Analytics.jsx)
Time Range Selection: Options to view data for different periods
Conversation Metrics: Charts showing conversation volume over time
Channel Distribution: Visual breakdown of usage across different channels
Agent Performance: Table comparing response times and satisfaction ratings
Tool Usage: Statistics on tool invocation frequency and success rates
Integration Points with Backend Services
To complete our MVP, we need to connect the frontend components with their corresponding backend services:
1. LangChain API Integration
Endpoint: https://api.enkisys.com/langchain/
Components to Connect:
Agents.jsx - For agent testing and conversation handling
AgentCreation.jsx - For creating and configuring agents
Dashboard.jsx - For recent conversation metrics
2. Tool Manager Integration
Endpoint: https://api.enkisys.com/toolmodule/
Components to Connect:
Tools.jsx - For CRUD operations on tools
Agents.jsx - For assigning tools to agents
Dashboard.jsx - For tool usage metrics
3. RAG Module Integration
Endpoint: https://api.enkisys.com/ragmodule/
Components to Connect:
GeneralKnowledge.jsx - For document upload and management
Agents.jsx - For assigning knowledge bases to agents
Dashboard.jsx - For document processing metrics
4. Multi-Tenant Authentication
Endpoint: https://api.enkisys.com/mtauth/
Components to Connect:
App.jsx - For user authentication and session management
MasterConfig.jsx - For tenant configuration
All components - For tenant-specific data retrieval
5. Channel Management
Endpoint: https://api.enkisys.com/channels/
Components to Connect:
Channels.jsx - For channel configuration and status
Agents.jsx - For assigning channels to agents
Dashboard.jsx - For channel usage metrics
Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Authentication & Base Configuration (Week 1)
Implement login/logout functionality in App.jsx
Connect MasterConfig.jsx to retrieve and update tenant settings
Set up global state management for tenant context
Implement API request interceptors for authentication headers
Phase 2: Tool & Knowledge Management (Week 2)
Connect Tools.jsx to Tool Manager API for CRUD operations
Implement tool testing functionality with real API calls
Connect GeneralKnowledge.jsx to RAG Module for document management
Implement document upload with progress tracking and status updates
Phase 3: Agent & Channel Configuration (Week 3)
Connect Agents.jsx and AgentCreation.jsx to LangChain API
Implement agent testing with real-time conversation
Connect Channels.jsx to Channel Management API
Implement channel testing and status monitoring
Phase 4: Dashboard & Analytics (Week 4)
Connect Dashboard.jsx to all services for metrics and recent activity
Implement real-time updates for dashboard statistics
Connect Analytics.jsx to reporting endpoints
Implement data visualization with real metrics
Phase 5: Testing & Optimization (Week 5)
End-to-end testing of all workflows
Performance optimization for data-heavy components
Responsive design refinements
Error handling and recovery improvements
Technical Considerations
API Communication
Implement a centralized API client with Axios
Use React Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization
Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
Add request/response interceptors for authentication and logging
State Management
Use React Context API for global state (authentication, tenant context)
Implement local component state for UI-specific concerns
Consider Redux for more complex state requirements if needed
Performance Optimization
Implement virtualization for long lists (documents, conversations)
Use code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
Optimize re-renders with React.memo and useMemo
Implement skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
Security Considerations
Implement proper CSRF protection
Store sensitive tokens securely
Sanitize all user inputs
Implement proper authorization checks on all API calls
Next Steps
API Client Setup: Create a centralized API client with proper authentication handling
Component Integration: Begin connecting frontend components to their respective backend services
Testing Framework: Implement end-to-end testing for critical workflows
Deployment Pipeline: Set up CI/CD for the frontend application
Documentation: Create comprehensive documentation for the frontend-backend integration
By following this implementation plan, we will have a fully functional MVP with a modern React frontend connected to our robust backend services, ready for initial customer demonstrations and feedback.
